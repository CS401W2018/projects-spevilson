    <h2>3. What are special entity characters?</h2>
    <p>Special entity characters are characters that we must put into HTML through special means other than printing it. For example, the less-than character, &#60, is used in HTML, and so we must print a code in order for that character to show up. </p>
    <h2>4. What are phrase tags?</h2>
    <p>Phrase tags are tags that change the way that a document looks, whether that's:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li><strong>making something bold</strong></li>
        <li><em>making something italic</em></li>
        <li><mark>highligting something</mark></li>
        <li><code>doing other cool stuff</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>5. What is the difference between ol and ul tags?</h2>
    <p>The difference between ol and ul tags are:</p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li><abbr title="ordered lists">ol</abbr> are numbered, <abbr title="unordered lists">ul</abbr> are not.</li>
        <li>Ordered lists can use numbers, letters. or roman numerals</li>
