        <h1>Answer questions:</h1>
        <h2>1. List out the different ways to select an item.</h2>
        <p>You can select through tag name, the descendant rule, ID, and through class. </p>
        <h2>2.What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h2>
        <p>Class is a selector that can be used in multiple tags, typically describes the contents of the tag, and can be used with other classes in one tag. ID is a selector that can only be used in one tag, typically is a noun that tells us what the tag contatins, and can't be used with other IDs.</p>
        <h2>3.What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h2>
        <p>A div tag causes a line break, but a span tag doesn't create any line breaks. They both create a sort of box around the text in the tag.</p>
        <h2>4.What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?</h2>
        <p>Practically, there is no difference in function between the tags. The only difference is when google reads the webpage, it can understand the header and main tags better because they are named instead of just a div tag.</p>
        <h2>5.What are the different ways to select a color?There is through the name, through RGB vlaues, through hexidecimal representations of RGB values, short version of hex, and hue saturation value. </h2>
