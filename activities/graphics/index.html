        <h1>Questions</h1>
        <h2>1. What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?
        </h2>
        <p>The best photos to encode using JPEG are photos of people, and real photos.</p>
        <h2>2. What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?
        </h2>
        <p>The best photos to encode using GIF are photos with not a lot of colors, and photos that are cartoons or logos.</p>
        <h2>3. What is unique about the PNG format?
        </h2>
        <p>The unique thing about .png files is that there is a transparent color that you're able to select and play with.</p>
        <h2>4. How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?
        </h2>
        <p>There are a few different software photo editors to use. My favorite one is the one that comes with Microsoft computers, the photo viewer/editor.</p>
        <h2>5. Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? 
        </h2>
        <p>If you resize photos using CSS, the size of the photo doesn't reduce, so it can use extra data on the user's phone and take extra time to load. But if you reduce the pixel count before uploading it to CSS, then it will be a smaller file and easier to download.</p>
