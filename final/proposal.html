            Questions and Answers

        <h2>The title and topic of your site.</h2>
        <p>The title- Star Wars Sequels. The topic- why I don't consider the Star Wars Sequels canon, and why they are the worst Star Wars movies.</p>
        <h2>A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h2>
        <p>I chose this topic because I have long wanted to analyze these movies. There has always been something off to me about them and I really don't like the plot and what they did to some of my favorite Star Wars characters. I think it will make this assignment easier because I am really passionate about it.</p>
        <h2>List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</h2>
        <p>The home page will have basic navigation for each of the five pages, plus my main arguments. I also expect it to display the movies in comparison to the past movies. For the five pages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Force Awakens spotlight</li>
            <li>The Last Jedi spotlight</li>
            <li>Rise of Skywalker spotlight</li>
            <li>Rey, The Emperor, Ben Solo, and Luke arc spotlight</li>
            <li>Ultimate comparison page between other Star Wars movies</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h2>
        <p>The data into the table will probably be something about streams, rotten tomatoes meters, revenue generated (scaled for inflation). The fields to collect in my form will be the viewers' own opinions about all this stuff.</p>
        <h2>How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h2>
        <p>I will use Wikipedia to gather sources and the movies along with IMBD to gather other information. Rotten tomatoes and Watchmojo are other sources I want to use.</p>
        <h2>Include a statement acknowledging that you have read the warnings below.</h2>
        <p>I have read the warnings and I promise to abide by them and try my best to do the project to the best of my own ability.</p>
