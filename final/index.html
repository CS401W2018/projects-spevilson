        <h1>General Review</h1>
        <p>The long-anticipated Star Wars prequel trilogy was exciting for every Star Wars fan. I still remember this legendary shot:</p>
        <img src="Screenshot 2025-04-05 011627.png" alt="Screenshot of YouTube playing the Force Awakens teaser">
        <p>Despite Forbes listing it as "The most expensive movie ever made, the first movie showed some promise, with some minor continuity errors and goofs. Then the trilogy descended into madness as it seemed the writers threw anything they wanted to into Star Wars. Force Lightning? Force Healing? Force rebirth and immortality? Immediate force prodigies without practice? Fight scenes with no point? Characters with no motivations?
        Sorry- I'm getting ahead of myself. Overall, the movies had great cinematics and scenes. The movies were very well shot.
