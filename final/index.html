                <p>Although maybe due to being "The most expensive movie ever made" <sup>1</sup>, the first movie showed some promise, with some minor continuity errors and goofs. Then the trilogy descended into madness as it seemed the writers threw anything they wanted to into Star Wars. Force lightning? Force healing? Force rebirth and immortality? Force link? Immediate force prodigies without practice? Fight scenes with no point? Characters with no motivations? <br><br>Sorry- I'm getting ahead of myself. Overall, the movies had great cinematics and scenes. The movies were very well shot. But in my opinion, the way that the movies added to the beloved Star Wars franchise was negative. This is due to three main reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of continuity between movies</li>
                    <li>Lack of or overwritten character development</li>
                    <li>Too much of a focus on commercialism</li>
                </ul>
