        <h1 class="border">The hero of DC current- <br>Thomas Edison</h1>
        <p>Thomas Edison is widely acknowledged as the inventor of the modern lightbulb. But his contribution to modern electricity is much greater than just lighting.</p>
        <h2>Some contributions of his:</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>1093 patents filed</dt>
            <dd>These included new and revolutionary telegraph equipment, the phonograph (which gave birth later to CD and HDD technology), various microphones for phones, the first x-ray machines, the first video cameras, an infrared camera, rechargeable batteries, and his famous lightbulbs.</dd>
            <dt>One of the first to argue for DC current</dt>
            <dd>He competed with many companies who wanted to install only AC in people's homes. He loved batteries and his obsession with DC current made it popular.</dd>
            <dt>Naval Consulting Board</dt>
            <dd>At the beginning of the 1st world war, Edison headed the science consulting board for the Navy. No one knows how many significant contributions he made to the war at the time.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Edison greatly advanced the world of electricity and helped all of mankind to jump a little bit further along the road, and unlock even more electrical secrets.</p>
