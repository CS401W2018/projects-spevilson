        <h2>Resistors</h2>
        <p>A <span id="boldword">resistor</span> is an electrical component that reduces the direct current electricity that is going through it. Resistance is measured in Ohms, and different elements or substances have different resistance. The less resistant an element is, the more conductive it is. Most resistors are made from ceramics or carbon film or dust.</p>
        <h2>Capacitors</h2>
        <p>A <strong>capacitor</strong> is an electrical component that stabilizes the current of a DC electrical circuit by connecting to both sides of the circuit. Electricity flows through the capacitor. When electrons stop flowing to the capacitor, or aren't consistent, the capacitor has stored up charge it lets out while it waits for the electrons to start moving again. Capacitance is measured in ferrings, (really micro-ferrings). Capacitors are especially important with things like motors, which depend on a stable DC power supply.</p>
        <h2>Transistors</h2>
        <p>A <strong>transistor</strong> is an electrically-controlled switch in a DC electrical circuit. There are three terminals, or legs of a transistor. They are the base (the switch), the collector (the positive side), and the emitter (the negative side). Any amount of voltage applied to the base terminal permits voltage to be let through the collector side to complete the circuit. </p>

            <li class="lessAttention">I used this color to de-emphasize words (#330)</li>
            <li>For the background, I chose a light yellow because of electricity, but I felt that the light coral color was a good way to emphasize the title of each page. For the extra font color I just played around with hex codes until I found something that I liked.</li>
