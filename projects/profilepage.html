    <h1>Hello, my name is Spencer Wilson</h1>
    <p>Here's a short introduction:<Br>
        I was born in Spokane Washington as the firstborn son of my mom and dad. As a kid, my dad <br> and I would do math problems, learn about animals, and eat Doritos. I grew up being best friends <br>with my brother Jay, who is two years younger than me. After a while, two <em>more</em> brothers came, <br>and they are awesome. <br>
        I was baptized at 8 years old, and when I was 11&frac12; we moved to be on the same street as the <br>Spokane Temple. I loved going to the temple then, and I also liked biking to Albertsons for <br>donuts. Some interests and hobbies that I have had since I was a child are:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Eating</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Playing music</li>
        <li>Building and inventing</li>
        <li>Star Wars</li>
        <li>Reading books</li>
        <li>Doing math</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I served my mission in Thailand and met my wife there. She is from Thailand, but also served as <br>a missionary there. We were married in August if last year, and I moved here to be with her.</p>
    <p>To elaborate on my list, my favorite things to eat are steak, burgers, Thai food, pasta, and <br>chocolate milk. I also really like to cook Thai food and pasta, but my favorite thing to cook is <br>new things that I make up on the spot. I used to be in a garage rock band playing electric guitar, <br>and I really like rock music. The most important thing to me is the gospel of Jesus Christ. <br> I have a testimony of Him and His love for me, and I will <strong>never</strong> deny that testimony. I love the <br>Book of Mormon, and the habits from my mission will always stay with me. One of my favorite <br>scriptures to think about recently: </p>
    <blockquote>"For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and <br>will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and <br>putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the <br>Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, <br>willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a <br>child doth submit to his father."</blockquote>
    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-King Benjamin</h3>

    <p>I think that something the Lord has tried to teach me in my life is patience, and how to submit to His will, like the Savior submitted to the Father's will.</p>

    Thanks for reading. <br>
