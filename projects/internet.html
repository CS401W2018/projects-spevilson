    <!--I put question numbers to help me go back
    and edit the questions easier-->

    <!--This is question number 1-->
    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>The internet is a big network of computers and 
        devices that talk and work together. It's the
        way that we communicate and access information.
    </p>

    <!--This is question number 2-->
    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>The Web is like a big library with really fast
        robot librarians that go and get the information
        that we need or ask for.
    </p>

    <!--This is question number 3-->
    <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p>If the Web is the system of librarians and books
        that make up the library system and make it 
        effective, the Internet is the building, the 
        tracks the robot librarians are on, and the 
        way that information gets everywhere.
    </p>

    <!--This is question number 4-->
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>ASCII and Unicode are ways to numerically represent
        letters, accents, and typing characters. ASCII
        is limited to the English language and roman 
        characters, while Unicode is internationally 
        compatible.
    </p>

    <!--This is question number 5-->
    <h2>What is UTF-8?</h2>
    <p>UTF-8 stands fr Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bit.
        It turns binary numbers in bytes (each formed by
        8 bits)into letters, based upon Unicode and ASCII
        codes. Example: A = 01000001
    </p>

    <!--This is question number 6-->
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p>Staying with the library metaphor, a URL (or 
        Uniform Resource Locator) is the location 
        of the book in the library that the user sees,
        and normally includes some sort of title for 
        the page.
    </p>

    <!--This is question number 7-->
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p>The domain name is the title of the book in the 
        library, easily searched by the person looking
        for the book, as opposed to the dewey decimal
        system, which would be harder.
    </p>

    <!--This is question number 8-->
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the way
        that the person searching is connected to the 
        server that holds the information that they need.
    </p>

    <!--This is question number 9-->
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>HTTP Secure, or HTTPS, is an encrypted version
        of HTTP.
    </p>

    <!--This is question number 10-->
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p>IP Address, or Internet Protocol Address, is the 
        numerical address of each device or page on the 
        Web. It is 4 digits that can each be represented by 
        a bit, so all the way up to 255. 
        For example, Google's IP address is 8.8.8.8
    </p>

    <!--This is question number 11-->
    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>The DNS, or Domain Name System, is the way that
        IP Addresses are matched, corresponded, and 
        connected to URLs.
    </p>

    <!--This is question number 12-->
    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>WWWC Recommendations are standards that each
        participant in the Web must follow to be a 
        part of it.
    </p>

    <!--This is question number 13-->
    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p>XML, or eXtensible Markup Language, is a language
        for creating documents that has tags that can be
        added to or extended. This is different than HTML,
        which is similar, but unable to be extended.
        HTML5 is the current version of HTML, and XHTML
        is like a mixture of XML and HTML.
